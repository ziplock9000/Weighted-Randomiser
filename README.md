# Weighted Randomiser
 A C# class to produce weighted random choices of any source type. I use this in some of my Unity projects.
 
 Performance, scalability and non-allocating updates welcomed.
 
 Windows console app to demonstrate the class
 
 It would be great if someone has time to optimise this to work for huge lists and pick random values very fast
