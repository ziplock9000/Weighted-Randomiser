# Weighted Randomiser
 A class to produce weighted random choices of any source type
 
Windows console app to demonstrate the class
 
It would be great if someone has time to optimise this to work for huge lists, pick random values very fast and have an unallocating version that would work well 
with games to reduce garbage collections
 
NOTE: Code originally from Philipp @ https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/162976/how-do-i-create-a-weighted-collection-and-then-pick-a-random-element-from-it
 

This should be a link to issue number 1
